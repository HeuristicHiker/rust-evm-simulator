# FAQTIAM

- **What does FAQTIAM mean?**
    - Frequently asked questions that I ask myself
- **Who is this for?**
    - Me.
- **Why did you create this project?**
    - I thought to myself "That would be cool" and here we are
- **Why make it public?**
    - There's no "private" in "public shaming for not committing enough to personal projects will hopefully motivate me"
- **Will this work?**
    - I really really doubt it
