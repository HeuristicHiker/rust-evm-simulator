# Thing To Start ðŸ¤¯


## Solidity Contract Basics

[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en) has so far been an excellent way to learn. I'm a sucker for anything that gives me the sweet dopamine bump of a gold star and saying I'm super smart after each lesson. Take notes Udemy.

## Understanding EVM Basics

## Rust implementation of EVM Core

## Handling Solidity Contracts

## Extending EVM Functionality

## Testing and Validation

# Things Done Poorly âœ…
## Setting Up Rust Environment

- **What does FAQTIAM mean?**
    - Frequently asked questions that I ask myself
- **Who is this for?**
    - Me.
