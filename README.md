This will be incredibly easy and I have all the faith that I can do this effectively.

## Setting Up Rust Environment

So, I did have Rust setup but then realized I broke the path when I fancied up my .zshrc so I started over. Steps are on [Do-I-Have-Rust](https://github.com/HeuristicHiker/rust-evm-simulator/wiki/Do-I-have-Rust%3F).

## Solidity Contract Basics

## What be contracts is?
[CryptoZombies](https://cryptozombies.io/en) has so far been an excellent way to learn. I'm a sucker for anything that gives me the sweet dopamine bump of a gold star and saying I'm super smart after each lesson. Take notes Udemy.

### Writing first contract to make a transfer between wallets
I've also setup a really really setupid contract. I'll be using truffle/ Ganache but just to get to a place where I can say

# FAQTIAM
- **What does FAQTIAM mean?**
    - Frequently asked questions that I ask myself
- **Who is this for?**
    - Me.
- **Why did you create this project?**
    - I thought to myself: "That would be cool" and here we are
- **Why make it public?**
    - There's no "private" in "public shaming for not committing enough to personal projects will hopefully motivate me"
- **Will this work?**
    - I really really doubt it
